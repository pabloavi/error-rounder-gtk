# Error rounder GTK

A multi-platform python script built using GTK that rounds experimental values according to its errors and generates different output formats for LaTeX. This project was created with [hello-world-gtk](https://github.com/zevlee/hello-world-gtk) as a template.

## TODO

- [ ] Add multi-language support (currently only supports Spanish)
- [ ] Improve error handling
- [ ] Add simple notification/inside-app-log support
